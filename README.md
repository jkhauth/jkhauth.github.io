# John Hauth Portfolio

My portfolio shows you not only my interests and what I like to do, but also my techinques when it comes to coding. Firstly, the framwork was built using Bootstrap to make easy to view on any deveice screen seamlessly. I like to stay detailed and make sure I know what I am coding and leaving a breadcrumb for whoever is looking at it. One of my passions is making sure that coding and different coding styles be available to everyone so we can build off of each other. 
Contacting someone in web development and viewing a portfolio should be easy, which is why I went with simplicty with the design. I want to present something that will leave an impact but also doesn't overdue it with all the bells and whistles. I believe being honest with your work and yourself drives success and helps you become a better coder.
