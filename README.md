## Installing Bootstrap

Finding the source code to use bootstrap was fairly ease to find and link to my site. I also downloaded built copy of the CSS and JS code so I could look for specific artibutes or classes.

## Navigation Bar

I learned how to make the responsive navigation bar by just following the docs in the Bootstrap docs. First I created the nav bar and filled in the brand name as my name for the placeholder. Once I figured out how to call and then minipulate the classes in other file, it become easier on how to use bootstrap.
